## üìã Phase Breakdown

### üîê PHASE 0: GitHub OAuth Foundation
**Goal**: Implement rock-solid GitHub OAuth authentication using proven patterns

#### 0.1 OAuth Architecture Setup
**Based on v2APIblaze Portal Implementation**
- **Auth Worker**: Dedicated Cloudflare Worker for OAuth handling auth.apiblaze.com (tokens not just for dashboard.apiblaze.com but also for *.apiblaze.com specifically projects that need oauth but don't bring their own idp). This code should be in  Its code should be in v2APIblaze/workers/apiblaze-auth-worker/ DO NOT MISTAKE THAT for the auth code for end users that's in  Its code should be in v2APIblaze/workers/auth-worker/ that's for *.auth.apiblaze.com
- **GitHub Provider**: Custom provider class with proper token management
- **State Management**: Secure state parameter handling with tenant info
- **Token Verification**: Robust token validation and caching
- **Security**: HTTP-only cookies, CSRF protection, secure redirects

#### 0.2 GitHub OAuth Flow Implementation
**Primary Flow (Proven Pattern)**:
1. **Login Initiation**: User clicks "Login with GitHub"
2. **State Generation**: Create secure state with tenant/version info
3. **GitHub Redirect**: Redirect to GitHub OAuth with proper scopes
4. **Callback Handling**: Exchange code for access token
5. **Token Storage**: Store token securely (HTTP-only cookies)
6. **User Verification**: Verify token and get user info
7. **Session Management**: Create secure session

#### 0.3 Token Management & Security
- **Access Token Storage**: HTTP-only cookies (not localStorage)
- **Token Verification**: Real-time GitHub API verification
- **Token Caching**: 5-minute cache for performance
- **Scope Management**: `read:user user:email` for basic access
- **Refresh Logic**: Handle token expiration gracefully
- **Security Headers**: Proper CORS, CSP, and security headers

#### 0.4 Backend Integration
- **API Authentication**: Secure API key generation and validation
- **User Management**: Store user info in D1 database
- **Session Handling**: Secure session management
- **Team Association**: Link users to teams and projects
- **Permission System**: Role-based access control

#### 0.5 Frontend Integration
- **Login Component**: Beautiful, accessible login UI
- **Auth State**: Global auth state management (Zustand)
- **Route Protection**: Protected routes and middleware
- **Loading States**: Smooth loading and error handling
- **User Menu**: User profile and logout functionality

**Success Criteria**:
- Login flow completes in <3 seconds
- Secure token storage (HTTP-only cookies)
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Seamless integration with backend API
- Mobile-responsive and accessible

**Technical Requirements**:
- Cloudflare Worker for OAuth handling
- GitHub OAuth App configuration
- Secure cookie management
- CSRF protection
- Proper error handling
- Comprehensive testing

### üöÄ PHASE 1: Project Creation Excellence
**Goal**: Build the best "create a project" experience possible

#### 1.1 Project Creation Modal/Page
**Priority**: GitHub OpenAPI Spec Selection (Primary Use Case)
- If Github App not installed, Ask user to authorize Github App with a value prop explaining why
- **GitHub Integration**: Browse repos, select OpenAPI specs
- **Smart Detection**: Auto-detect OpenAPI files in repos
- **Preview**: Show spec preview before creation
- **Validation**: Real-time spec validation
- **One-Click**: Create project from GitHub spec

**Secondary**: Manual Configuration
- **Target Server**: Enter server URL


**Tertiary UI ONLY/No backend for now**: Upload OpenAPI Spec
- **Drag & Drop**: Upload spec files
- **Validation**: Real-time spec validation
- **Preview**: Show parsed spec before creation
- Save the file in cloudflare R2 (you will have to modify internalapi.apiblaze.com in v2APIblaze for that. You can punt this for now and just put the ui in place)


#### 1.2 Project Configuration before creation
Read and execute configurator.txt for specification


#### 1.3 Success Flow
- **Confirmation**: Clear "Deploying" message
- CTA to Create a project (again)
- **List**: Once the first project is created, get out of zero state and present the tenant with a list of projects even if it's only just this one project
- ** Attributes of each project : Project name, api version, deployment status, github details, avatar and details of the deployer
- ** buttons to update the config and re-release, access a modal to delete, open a new tab to the api dev portal  
- ** deployment status of each project (Deploying xx seconds, Ready xx seconds (yy min ago)), red amber green light
- and pagination amongst projects


**Success Criteria**:
- User can create project in <10 seconds
- GitHub integration feels native
- Manual config is comprehensive but not overwhelming and defaults allow to bypass and just deploy in 1 second
